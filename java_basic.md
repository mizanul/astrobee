Sure! Let's start with a basic Java tutorial. In this tutorial, we'll cover the fundamentals of Java programming language from variables to control structures. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### 1. Setting Up Java Development Environment
To write and run Java programs, you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download it from the official Oracle website and follow the installation instructions.

### 2. Writing Your First Java Program
Let's start with a simple "Hello, World!" program.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

Save this code in a file named `HelloWorld.java`. Compile it using the `javac` command:

```
javac HelloWorld.java
```

This command will generate a `HelloWorld.class` file, which contains bytecode. Now, run the program using the `java` command:

```
java HelloWorld
```

You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the console.

### 3. Variables and Data Types
In Java, variables are containers for storing data. Java has several built-in data types, including `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`, etc.

```java
public class VariablesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int age = 25;
        double height = 5.9;
        boolean isStudent = true;
        char grade = 'A';
        String name = "John";

        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
        System.out.println("Height: " + height);
        System.out.println("Is Student: " + isStudent);
        System.out.println("Grade: " + grade);
    }
}
```

### 4. Control Structures
Java provides various control structures like `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and `switch` for decision-making and looping.

```java
public class ControlStructuresExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int number = 10;

        if (number > 0) {
            System.out.println("Positive number");
        } else if (number < 0) {
            System.out.println("Negative number");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Zero");
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Iteration: " + i);
        }

        int i = 0;
        while (i < 5) {
            System.out.println("While loop: " + i);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Java is an object-oriented programming language. Here's a simple example of creating a class and an object.

```java
public class Car {
    String color;
    String model;

    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving the " + color + " " + model);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car();
        myCar.color = "Red";
        myCar.model = "Toyota";
        myCar.drive();
    }
}
```

This covers some of the basic concepts of Java programming. There's a lot more to explore, such as methods, arrays, classes, inheritance, interfaces, and exceptions. Keep practicing and experimenting to become proficient in Java programming.
